Accomponies [the following blog post:)](https://hackernoon.com/machine-learning-for-isic-skin-cancer-classification-challenge-part-1-ccddea4ec44a)

* Does not contain the dataset used in the blog post. You can find the data [on the ISIC website](https://isic-archive.com/)
* Not exactly beautiful code here
* There is some code here for experiments I did later (such as thresholding the images and seeing how that affected accuracy). The thresholding code is not here.
