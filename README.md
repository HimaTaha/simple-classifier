# A basic classifier for the ISIC challenge. 


* Does not contain the dataset used. You can get a subset of the dataset from the ISIC challenge. 
* Will have an accompying blog post soon. 
* Not exactly beautiful code here
* There is some code here for experiments I did later (such as thresholding the images and seeing how that affected accuracy). The thresholding code is not here.
